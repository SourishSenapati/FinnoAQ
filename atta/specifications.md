# Atta (Natural Bio-Additive) Project Specifications

## 1. Executive Summary

Produce premium "Soft Roti" Atta at a target retail price of **₹30/kg** (vs Market ₹40-50) using **Enzymatic Bio-Additives** to enable 98% Extraction Rate (High Bran inclusion) while softening the texture naturally.

## 2. Formulation Strategy

- **Wheat Blend**: 70% Soft Wheat (Cheaper) + 30% Hard Wheat (Gluten strength).
- **Bio-Additive (The Secret Sauce)**:
  - **Malted Wheat Flour**: 0.5% (Natural Amylase source).
  - **Papaya Latex (Papain) / Pineapple (Bromelain)**: Trace amounts (Optional) for gluten relaxation.
- **Processing**:
  - **Micronization**: Impact milling bran to <50 microns.
  - **Starch Damage**: Controlled to 7-8% for optimal water absorption.

## 3. Cost Analysis (Per Kg)

- **Raw Wheat**: ₹22.50 (Blended cost)
- **Milling/Power**: ₹2.50
- **Packaging**: ₹1.50
- **Bio-Additives**: ₹0.10
- **Total Cost**: ~₹26.60
- **Margin**: ₹3.40 (at ₹30 RSP)

## 4. Simulation Goals

1.  **Farinograph Simulation**: Water Absorption % vs. Starch Damage.
2.  **Enzyme Kinetics**: Rate of starch hydrolysis (Softening) vs. Time.
3.  **Cost Blending**: Linear Programming to minimize Wheat Cost while meeting Protein specs.

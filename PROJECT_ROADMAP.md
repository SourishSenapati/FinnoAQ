# FINNO PROJECTS: Strategic Technical Roadmap (Natural & Cost-Optimized)

This document outlines the **Scientific & Commercial Goals** for each project vertical.
**Core Constraints:**

1.  **100% Natural / Clean Label**: No synthetic chemicals or artificial additives.
2.  **Aggressive Cost Engineering**: Targeting huge price disruptions (e.g., Mustard Oil @ ~50% market price).

## 1. SUNDARBAN HONEY (Reaction + Bulk Storage)

**Challenge**: High moisture (>22%) causes fermentation. High heat destroys delicate mangrove floral compounds.

### Achievable Goals (Natural Process)

- **Zero-Heat Moisture Reduction**: Utilize **Vacuum Desiccation** (Pressure swing) or **Silica Gel/Zeolite Dehumidification** (Physical adsorption) to drop moisture to <19% without heating above 38°C.
- **Natural Stabilization**: Use **Clove Extract (Eugenol)** or **Cinnamon** infusion as a natural anti-microbial to serve as a shelf-life booster (replacing chemical preservatives).
- **HMF Control**: Strict temperature monitoring to keep HMF <10mg/kg naturally.

**Target KPI**: 24-Month Shelf Life | **Raw & Unfiltered Certification**.

## 2. MUSTARD HONEY (Value Addition: Wine, Jam, Jelly)

**Challenge**: Rapid crystallization and pungent flavor limit table use.

### Achievable Goals (Natural Diversification)

- **Creamed Honey (Physical Texturing)**: Use **Controlled Seeding** (adding fine starter crystals) and precise temperature cycling (14°C) to create a smooth, butter-like texture without additives.
- **Natural Mead Fermentation**: Develop a **Wild Yeast** or **Wine Yeast (S. cerevisiae)** strain optimization profile to ferment mustard honey into a dry, crisp wine (12% ABV).
- **Fruit Pectin Jellies**: Use **Apple Pectin** or **Citrus Peel** extract (natural gelling agents) + Lemon Juice (pH control) to set jellies instead of synthetic gelatin/thickeners.

**Target KPI**: **>300% Value Addition** vs raw commodity price.

## 3. GHEE (Bilona Method)

**Challenge**: Low yield of traditional hand-churning makes it expensive suitable only for ultra-premium markets.

### Achievable Goals (Process Efficiency)

- **Cultured Curd Optimization**: Use specific **Lactobacillus** strains that naturally weaken fat globule membranes during culturing, maximizing butter release during churning.
- **Thermal Profiling**: Precise simulation of the boiling curve to stop exactly at the "Granulation Point" (Danedar texture) before burning, preserving natural antioxidants (CLA).
- **Yield Maximization**: Recover residual fat from buttermilk (Chaas) using centrifugal separation for a secondary "cooking ghee" stream to lower overall wastage.

**Target KPI**: **Yield Improvement +15%** | **100% Traditional Cultured Taste**.

## 4. ATTA (Price ₹30/kg + Natural Bio-Additive)

**Challenge**: Delivering premium "soft roti" quality at a discount price (₹30/kg) using only natural ingredients.

### Achievable Goals (Natural Cost Engineering)

- **Malted Wheat Enzyme (Diastatic Malt)**: Add 0.5% **Sprouted/Malted Wheat Flour**. This provides natural amylase enzymes that break down starch into sugars, keeping rotis soft _without_ synthetic softeners.
- **Bran Micronization**: Use **Impact Milling** (Physical) to pulverize bran so finely it doesn't tear the gluten network, allowing High Extraction (95% Yield) while feeling like refined flour.
- **Supply Chain Arbitrage**: Simulation model to blend different wheat varieties (e.g., cheaper soft wheat + strong hard wheat) to hit the ₹24/kg raw material cost target.

**Target KPI**: **Super-Soft Roti** for 12+ hours | **Clean Label (Wheat + Malt only)**.

## 5. MUSTARD OIL (Herbal Infusion - Disruptive Price)

**Challenge**: Target price is ~50% of leading brands (approx. ₹80-100/kg target).

### Achievable Goals (Radical Cost Reduction)

- **Integrated Crushing Economics**: The Cost of Oil = (Seed Cost) - (Cake Revenue).
  - **Goal**: Maximize the value of **Mustard De-Oiled Cake (Doc)**. Develop a high-protein "Mustard Flour" or premium cattle feed from the waste to subsidize the oil cost.
- **Grade B Blending (Natural)**: Formulate a **"Multi-Source Edible Oil"** legally compliant blend (e.g., 20% Mustard (High Pungency) + 80% Rice Bran/Soy).
  - _Essential Requirement_: Even at 20% concentration, the "Mustard Kick" must be potent.
  - **Natural Potency Booster**: Infuse **Capsicum Oleoresin** (Chilli extract) or concentrated **Mustard Essential Oil** (distilled from husks) to replicate the strong "Kachhi Ghani" punch in a cheaper base oil.
- **Herbal Preservation**: Use **Turmeric and Clove Oil** infusions not just for health, but as **Natural Antioxidants** to extend shelf life without TBHQ (synthetic preservative).

**Target KPI**: **Price < ₹100/kg** | **Strong Pungency** | **Zero Synthetic Preservatives**.

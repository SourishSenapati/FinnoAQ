# Mustard Honey Value Addition Project Specifications

## 1. Executive Summary

Transform low-value Mustard Honey (prone to crystallization) into high-value products: **Creamed Honey**, **Mead (Wine)**, and **Honey Jelly**.

## 2. Product 1: Creamed Honey (Spreadable)

- **Concept**: Controlled crystallization to create smooth, butter-like texture.
- **Process**:
  - **Seeding**: Add 10% fine-crystal "starter" honey.
  - **Temperature Cycling**: Hold at 14°C (Optimum Nucleation) for 72 hours.
  - **Mixing**: Slow agitation to break large crystals.
- **Additives**: None (Physical process only).

## 3. Product 2: Honey Mead (Winemaking)

- **Style**: Dry/Semi-Sweet Traditional Mead.
- **ABV**: 12-14%
- **Fermentation**:
  - **Yeast**: _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ (Wine Strain).
  - **Nutrient**: Bee Pollen (Natural Nitrogen source).
  - **Time**: 21 days primary, 3 months aging.
- **Cost**: Raw Honey (₹80/kg) -> Mead (₹800/bottle).

## 4. Product 3: Honey Jelly (Vegan/Natural)

- **Gelling Agent**: High-Methoxyl Pectin (Apple extract) @ 1.5%.
- **Acidifier**: Lemon Juice (Citric Acid) to pH 3.2 for setting.
- **Use Case**: Spreadable, heat-stable jelly.

## 5. Simulation Goals

1. **Crystallization Rate**: Nucleation vs. Temperature curve (Target 14°C).
2. **Fermentation Kinetics**: Sugar consumption rate (Brix drop) vs. Time for Mead.
3. **Gel Strength**: Bloom strength prediction based on Pectin:Acid ratio.

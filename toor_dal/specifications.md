## 2. Optimized Formulation and Cost Structure

### 2.1 Raw Material Composition (MSG-Optimized)

The formulation utilizes a synergistic blend of pigeon pea brokens, starch sources, and hydrocolloids. Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is incorporated at a sub-threshold level (0.35%) to mask starch dilution effects and enhance savory perception without compromising the traditional legume flavor profile.

## 4. Technical Specifications and Process Parameters

### 4.1 Dry Feed Rheology

- **Particle Size Distribution**: Ball-milled to <150 µm to ensure uniform hydration and a smooth protein-starch matrix.
- **Matrix Modifiers**:
  - **Glycerol Monostearate (E471)**: 1.0% inclusion to induce amylose-lipid complexation, reducing extrudate stickiness and improving bite texture.
  - **Sodium Alginate + Calcium Lactate**: Forms a heat-stable ionic gel preventing disintegration during boiling.

### 4.2 Hydration and Extrusion

- **Target Moisture Content**: 30% ± 2% (wet basis).
- **Water Addition Rate**: 300 ml per kg of dry mix.
- **pH Control**: Adjusted to 5.5–6.0 using Citric Acid to optimize alginate setting kinetics and Nisin stability.
- **Thermal Profile**:
  - **Pre-conditioning**: 80–90°C (Partial gelatinization).
  - **Extrusion Die Temperature**: ~60°C (Prevents premature alginate cross-linking).
  - **Die Geometry**: 3.0–4.0 mm circular aperture.

### 4.3 Preservation System

- **Internal (Phase A)**: Nisin A (12.5 ppm pure basis) targeting _Bacillus cereus_ spore inhibition.
- **Surface Coating (Phase B)**: Post-drying application (<40°C) of a hydrophobic blend comprising 98% Refined Castor Oil and 2% Clove Oil (0.5–1.0% w/w application rate). This provides a matte "unpolished" finish and improved oxidative stability.

### 4.4 Drying Dynamics

- **Method**: Vacuum Drying @ 60°C.
- **Target Final Moisture**: <10%.
- **Constraint**: Controlled drying rate required to prevent stress cracking and checking in the final product.

## 5. Regulatory Compliance

- **MSG Limits**: The 0.35% inclusion rate adheres to FSSAI Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for processed cereal-pulse analogues.
- **Labeling**: Ingredient declaration required ("Contains Added Monosodium Glutamate").
- **Validation**: Sensory and microbial stability validation to be conducted on finished product after a minimum 7-day maturation period.

# Mustard Oil (Herbal Fusion) Project Specifications

## 1. Executive Summary

Disrupt the market with a **₹100/kg** Herbal Mustard Oil (approx 50% of premium brand price) by using a **Blended Base** infused with **Natural Mustard Essential Oil** and **Chillies** for pungency, subsidized by high-value cake utilization.

## 2. Formulation (The "Hack")

- **Base Oil**: 80% Refined Rice Bran Oil (Neutral, Cheap, Healthy).
- **Mustard Component**: 20% Kachhi Ghani Mustard Oil (for color/base flavor).
- **Pungency Booster (Natural)**:
  - **Mustard Essential Oil (Allyl Isothiocyanate)**: 500ppm (Distilled from waste husks).
  - **Chilli Oleoresin**: Trace amount for "throat hit".
- **Preservation**:
  - **Turmeric Extract**: Color + Antioxidant.
  - **Clove Oil**: Anti-rancidity.

## 3. Integrated Economics

- **Oil Cost**: Subsidized by selling "Mustard Flour" (Protein rich) from the cake at premium rates to feed/export markets.
- **Target Cost**: ₹85/kg (Bulk).
- **Retail Price**: ₹99/kg.

## 4. Simulation Goals

1. **Blending Optimization**: Minimize Cost vs. Pungency Index.
2. **Oxidative Stability**: Rancimat simulation (Induction time) with Clove/Turmeric.
3. **Sedimentation**: Stoke's Law for herbal particle suspension.
